- Hi, I'm Steven
- I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering
- I chose my major because I'd like to help my local community in means of engineering, as well as having income (lol).
- A fun fact about me is: I have a large vinyl collection.
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  Hoping to gain more insight with coding languages, as well as using object-oriented programming in projects like UXO's, detection, etc.
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky
